# Lexicon Mini Project week 12(product list)
This is a project for a c# course run by Lexicon

# Notes
- I learned you can use ,-20 instead of PadRight(20).
- I use a named paramter(searchTerm) for the DisplayItems function. This way if they are not searching it will display all items normally

# Possible Improvements
- The way I ask for input by the user is maybe a bit confusing
